You can test the game by opening it on 2 seperate tabs: https://battleships-vz4t.onrender.com. It's made for 2 players only but you can reset the lobby with Reset button in main menu. It is a little laggy and slow because I'm using a free hosting plan, it works perfectly fine on localhost. It might load longer than a normal site for the same reason.

One commit only because it was originally made without using GitHub and then entirely uploaded

You can test the game by opening it on 2 seperate tabs: https://battleships-vz4t.onrender.com. It's made for 2 players only but you can reset the lobby with Reset button in main menu. It is a little laggy and slow because I'm using free hosting plan, it works perfectly fine on localhost.

One commit only because it was originally made without using GitHub and then entirely uploaded
